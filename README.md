# Project: Simple Library Management System
## Description:
A simplified version of a Library Management System that doesn't require a database or user authentication. It focuses on basic book management and borrowing functionalities using core Java features.
# Key Features:
## Book Management:
Add new books with basic details like title, author, and quantity.
View a list of available books in the library.
Allow librarians to update or delete existing books.
Borrowing and Returning Books:
Allow users to borrow books from the library.
Check book availability before issuing loans.
Record borrowed books and track their return status.
# Fine Management:
Calculate fines for overdue books based on predefined rules.
Notify users about pending fines and overdue books.
# Reporting:
Generate reports on borrowed books, overdue books, fine collections, etc.
Display statistics and analytics on library usage.
# User Interface:
Design a simple console-based interface for librarians and users.
Provide interactive menus and prompts for performing library operations.
# Project Structure:
Create classes for books, users, and transactions to model library entities.
Use arrays or collections like ArrayList to manage collections of books and users.
Implement methods for adding, updating, and deleting books, as well as borrowing and returning books.
Design a simple text-based interface using System.out.println() statements and Scanner for user input.
# Additional Challenges:
Implement error handling to validate user input and handle edge cases gracefully.
Experiment with different data structures and algorithms to optimize book searching and retrieval.
Enhance the user interface with ASCII art or color coding for a more engaging experience.
Explore multithreading to simulate concurrent book borrowing and returning activities.
